## About Rust

> **History**
> Rust is a relatively new language compared to other programming languages,
> as well as its predecessors in which it is based off of. It first started out
> as a personal project in 2006 by Mozilla Research employeee Graydon Hoare.
> Rust is a systems programming language focused on memory safety while still
> maintaining high performance, as well as safe concurrency. Its creator stated
> that it was possibly named after the rust family of fungi. Rust uses LLVM 
> as its backend.
  
> **Interesting features**
> - Safe
> - Low-level
> - High-performance
> - Supports multiple paradigms of programming such as imperative, functional and object-oriented
  
> **Fun facts**
> - Its compiler is written in Rust itself and can compile its own source code
> - Won 1st place for "Most Loved Programming Language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2016, 2017, and 2018
> - Below is the logo of Servo, a Rust project by Mozilla for an experimental web browser engine

## Syntax

> Rust source code is stored in .rs files

### Basic 'Hello, World!' program:
```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## About the tools

> **Getting started with Rust (on macOS/Linux)**
>
> Installation:
> `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`	- Downloads and installs *rustup*, which installs Rust (Requires a log-out)
>
> Updating Rust:
> `rustup update stable`
  
> **Cargo**
> Rust's compiler/build tool, which also functions as a package manager for tools for Rust known as 'components'
> 
> Some basic commands:
> - `cargo --version`	- Checks for and displays the current version of Rust installed
> - `cargo build`		- Build your project
> - `cargo run`			- Run your project
> - `cargo test`		- Test your project
> - `cargo update`		- Update the dependencies of your project
> - `cargo doc`			- Generate the documentation for your project
> - `cargo publish`		- Publish your project to [crates.io], the open community repository of Rust binaries and libraries

[crates.io]: https://crates.io/

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
